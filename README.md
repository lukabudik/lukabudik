# Hey, I'm Luka üëã

Frontend dev who occasionally convinces himself he can do backend too. Building AI stuff that might actually be useful.

## üë®‚Äçüíª About Me

- Building AI tools for legal professionals at [Advomate](https://advomate.ai)
- Recently won 3rd place at a hackathon (mostly by nodding along while the real engineers worked)
- I say I'm a full-stack developer, but we all know which side of the stack gets all the love
- My code is like my coffee - mostly works, occasionally brilliant, sometimes keeps me up at night

## üìä My Impressive GitHub Journey

<img src="https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api/top-langs/?username=lukabudik&layout=compact&theme=dracula" alt="Top Languages" />

**Commit Philosophy:** Why make 50 small, sensible, reviewable commits when you can make one massive commit titled "It works now"?

**My GitHub R√©sum√©:**
- Total PRs: Enough to count on one hand
- Contributed to: That one project that one time
- Commit Messages: Range from "Fixed stuff" to "Please work"
- Code Reviews: What are those?

*I believe git blame is a personal attack feature and should be disabled.*

## üî• Current Project: Dustebin

A code sharing platform I built while procrastinating on other work. Like a better Pastebin, with syntax highlighting and image support.

*If my GitHub stats look concerning, that's because my best code is in private repos... at least that's what I tell recruiters.*
