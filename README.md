# Hey, I'm Luka üëã

Frontend dev who occasionally convinces himself he can do backend too. Building AI stuff that might actually be useful.

## üë®‚Äçüíª About Me

- Building AI tools for legal professionals at [Advomate](https://advomate.cz)
- Recently won 3rd place at a hackathon (mostly by nodding along and clutching in the last possible moment)
- Master of the "it works on my machine" guarantee
- Firm believer that the best code is the code you didn't have to write (for LinkedIn bros - not actually serious about this)

## üíª My Coding Philosophy

<img src="https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api/top-langs/?username=lukabudik&layout=compact&theme=dracula" alt="Top Languages" />

**Commit Style:** One commit to rule them all, one commit to find them, one commit to bring them all, and in the codebase bind them.

**Vibe Coding Pioneer:** I was vibe coding before it was cool. My workflow:
1. Spend 30 minutes putting together a complex knowledge base of the tech we're working with
2. Tell Claude everything I need and let him iterate (spending a lot of $$$ on API credits, but still a no-brainer)
3. If needed, give him additional tooling access
4. Let Claude use computer use, testing the code himself
5. Review the AI-generated code (yes, I actually understand it)
6. Modify until it's perfect
7. Take full credit at stand-up

*10x developer? More like 1x developer with 10x AI assistance.*

## üî• Current Project: Dustebin

A code sharing platform that lets you share code snippets with syntax highlighting, privacy options, and AI-generated metadata. Because who doesn't need another place to store their half-finished projects?
